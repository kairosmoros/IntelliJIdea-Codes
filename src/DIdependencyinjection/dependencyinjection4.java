/* Field Injection
Note : In plain java, this type is discouraged unless with frameworks.
        You lose control over dependency visibility and testability
        Preferred only in Spring , and even there, constructor injection is generally recommended.


    Example using Spring-style annotations:
 */
/*  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotations.Autowired;
class  Car
{
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;//Field Injection
    public void drive()
    {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("car is moving");
    }
}
public class dependencyinjection4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
