/* TRICK TO BUILD A DESIGN BEFORE CODING :
‚úÖ 1. Think in terms of responsibility (Who ‚Äúowns‚Äù what?)
Ask:

Who logically owns or manages the thing?

In your case:

Does each platform manage a list of other platforms? ‚ùå That makes no sense.

Does a station manage multiple platforms? ‚úÖ Yes. That‚Äôs its job.
Put the list where the group naturally belongs

‚úÖ 2. Every class should be responsible for itself ‚Äî and nothing more.
A Platform should know about:

its number

its status

A Station should know about:

the list of Platforms

assigning trains to platforms
DON‚ÄôT give a class responsibilities it shouldn't own.

üöÄ Pro-Tip: How to Start Writing These Kinds of Codes
When you face any such problem, follow this golden sequence:

üí° Think: ‚ÄúNouns ‚Üí Classes, Verbs ‚Üí Methods‚Äù
Let‚Äôs take your Station/Train example:

1. List all nouns
Train ‚Üí class

Platform ‚Üí class

Station ‚Üí class

Status ‚Üí a field inside Platform
2. List the relationships
A Station has many Platforms ‚úÖ

A Train arrives at a Platform ‚úÖ

3. List all actions
Train arrives ‚Üí method in Train or Station

Show status ‚Üí method in Platform
Then you structure accordingly.

If it‚Äôs a list of Books, and a Library owns them ‚Üí List goes in Library

If it‚Äôs a list of Songs, and a Playlist owns them ‚Üí List goes in Playlist
