            /* 1. Mutual Exclusion (ME): Only one thread can execute the synchronized block or method at a time, preventing
multiple threads from accessing the shared resource simultaneously.
2. Eliminates Race Conditions: By restricting access to one thread, it prevents race conditions where threads
compete to modify shared data, leading to unpredictable results.
3. Prevents Data Inconsistency: Since only one thread can modify the shared resource at a time, the data remains
consistent and correct.
When a thread enters a synchronized block or method, it acquires a lock (on the object or class), and no other thread
 can enter that critical section until the first thread completes and releases the lock. Other threads wait in a queue
  until the lock is available.*/

        /*How are we able to use t1.setName("Thread-1") even though we havenâ€™t defined a setName() method in the CounterThread class?

ðŸ”¸ Answer:
You're able to call setName() on t1, t2, etc., because your CounterThread class extends Thread, and the Thread class (from java.lang.Thread) already provides a method called setName(String name).

So you're inheriting this method.

ðŸ”¹ Think of it like this:
java
Copy code
class CounterThread extends Thread {
    // inherits everything from java.lang.Thread:
    // - start()
    // - run()
    // - getName()
    // - setName(String)
    // - join()
    // - etc.
}
You don't need to write setName() yourself because it's already available in the Thread class. Since CounterThread is a subclass of Thread, it can directly use setName().

ðŸ”¸ Extra Tip:
If you print the thread name inside the run() method, it will show the name you've set:

java
Copy code
@Override
public void run() {
    System.out.println("Running " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    ...
}
This helps in debugging multi-threaded programs by identifying which thread is doing what.

Method	Defined In	Why You Can Use It

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        System.out.println("Final count (shared) = " + sharedCounter.getCount());

        System.out.println("\n=== Scenario 2: Separate Counters ===");
        // Scenario 2: Each thread has its own counter
        counter counter1 = new counter();
        counter counter2 = new counter();
        CounterThread t3 = new CounterThread(counter1);
        CounterThread t4 = new CounterThread(counter2);
        t3.setName("Thread-3");
        t4.setName("Thread-4");
        t3.start();
        t4.start();
        t3.join();
        t4.join();
        System.out.println("t3 count (separate) = " + counter1.getCount());
        System.out.println("t4 count (separate) = " + counter2.getCount());
    }
